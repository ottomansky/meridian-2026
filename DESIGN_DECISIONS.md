# MERIDIAN — Design Decisions

Living record of strategic decisions made while building the flagship site.
Each entry: **decision**, then **why** (the constraint or trade-off that led there).

## Product

**MERIDIAN — an operating system for customer-lifecycle intelligence.**

- _Audience_: forward-looking data + revenue-ops teams evaluating modern customer-intelligence platforms.
- _Core surfaces_: `/` Landing · `/product` Product · `/signals` Live Signals (real preview against Keboola project 2000's CLA_Customer_Lifecycle data) · `/manifesto` Manifesto · `/pricing` Pricing.
- _Brand mood_: "Linear meets Igloo Inc — clinical precision meets dichroic alien materials. Instrument panels for things that haven't been built yet."

The Live Signals surface is the differentiator — the site is also a working data viewer. Everything else is marketing scaffolding around that core.

## Stack — locked per brief, with version pins

| Layer        | Choice                                             | Notes                                                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework    | Next.js 15.5.18 (App Router, Turbopack)            | Pinned to 15.x per brief, even though 16.x is current.      |
| Runtime      | React 19.2 / Node ≥ 20                             |                                                             |
| Output       | `standalone`                                       | Required for Keboola data-app deployment.                   |
| Styling      | Tailwind v4 CSS-first (`@theme` block)             | No `tailwind.config.ts`. Tokens in `app/globals.css`.       |
| Color        | oklch end-to-end                                   | One hue ramp per surface family; dark default.              |
| Lint/format  | Biome 2.x                                          | Replaces ESLint+Prettier.                                   |
| Motion       | Motion (formerly Framer Motion) + GSAP/ScrollTrigger + Lenis | Each used where it's strongest.                     |
| 3D           | R3F + drei + postprocessing                        | Hero shader + interactive material moments.                 |
| Theming      | next-themes                                        | dark default, light is a polished override.                 |

## Typography

- **Display** — **Fraunces** (Google Fonts / OFL). Variable: `opsz`, `wght`, `SOFT`, `WONK`. Used for all headlines and the per-page oversized moment. `opsz 144 / wght 500 / SOFT 100` is the headline default; reduces to `opsz 14 / wght 400 / SOFT 0` for inline serif.
- **Body** — **Bricolage Grotesque** (Google Fonts / OFL). Variable: `wght`, `opsz`, `wdth`. Used for paragraph text and UI. Width axis is animated on hover for navigation labels.
- **Mono** — **JetBrains Mono Variable** (Google Fonts / OFL). Used for eyebrow labels, numerals, code, and the "instrument-panel" copy that wants a technical feel.

**Why this trio:**

- The brief banned Inter as display, Roboto, system-ui as body, and "Space Grotesk everywhere". Fraunces is editorial and expressive enough to feel like a print object on screen; Bricolage is a modern grotesque that is _not_ generic; JetBrains Mono Variable carries the instrument-panel signage.
- All three are OFL-licensed → safe for commercial deployment, no fontshare contract needed, no .woff2 download required (Google Fonts host them).
- All three are real variable fonts so we can animate `font-variation-settings` on hover and at scale, per the brief.

If we ever swap to a paid pairing (PP Editorial New + PP Neue Montreal, the brief's first suggestion), the swap is one `next/font/local` block — the rest of the system already references `--font-display` / `--font-sans` / `--font-mono`.

## Color

Monochromatic deep-blue-grey base, **one** electric accent.

```
--color-ink         oklch(0.135 0.014 250)   bg dark
--color-paper       oklch(0.97 0.006 82)     fg on dark
--color-bone        oklch(0.975 0.005 82)    bg light (warm off-white, NOT #fff)
--color-flux        oklch(0.82 0.15 198)     the one electric note (ice-cyan)
```

- Background hue 250 (cool steel) → reads instrument-panel, not "blue".
- Background light is warm off-white (hue 82) → contrasts with the cool surface and gives the light theme a deliberate paper-y character. Pure white is banned by the brief.
- Accent hue 198 is between cyan and azure — CRT cyan, but unsaturated enough to never read neon. _One_ accent only. No purple→blue, teal→pink, or "AI lavender" gradients.
- Iridescent / material tints (`--color-iris-1..4`) exist only for shader work and dichroic surfaces. They are not application colors.

## Material atmosphere

- **Grain** — every surface. `public/assets/grain.svg` generated via `feTurbulence`, applied at `mix-blend-mode: overlay` with `opacity: 0.06–0.08`. Fixed-position on the body so it never tiles into a moiré pattern.
- **Glass** — backdrop-blur 18px + saturate 140% + 10% foreground border. Reserved for floating nav and command-palette layers. Not for "frosted card" backgrounds — those use `.surface` instead.
- **Chromatic aberration** — `.flux-hover` utility splits text-shadow on hover with red/cyan offsets. Used sparingly on the largest interactive titles.
- **Iridescent / dichroic** — only via R3F shader (Phase 1 `ShaderBackground`). No CSS-only iridescence — it always reads cheap.

## Motion

Reusable primitives live in `components/motion/` and each gets a demo route at `/styleguide/motion/[name]`.

Easing palette in tokens:

```
--ease-out-quint    cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)    -- default for in-motion
--ease-out-expo     cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)     -- counters, big swings
--ease-in-out-quad  cubic-bezier(0.45, 0, 0.55, 1)    -- bidirectional
--ease-back         cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1) -- spring-feel without physics
--ease-instr        cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)    -- "instrument" feel, deliberate
```

Hard rule per brief: `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` kills decorative motion (`.marquee-track`, `.reveal`, anything with `data-motion-decorative`), but keeps state-change transitions.

Native CSS `animation-timeline: view()` powers the default reveal. GSAP ScrollTrigger fallback only when we need scrub/pin behavior the spec doesn't expose yet.

## Keboola deployment

- Repo will be pushed to a new GitHub repository.
- `keboola-config/` (nginx 8888 → Next.js 3000, supervisord with `npm start`, setup.sh `npm ci --omit=dev` against pre-committed `.next/standalone`) lands in Phase 3.
- `output: "standalone"` in `next.config.ts` so the deploy artifact is a single Node bundle with no `next build` step required at container start (Keboola contract: don't build during `setup.sh`, commit the build instead).
- Live Signals page reads from project 2000's CLA_Customer_Lifecycle via Keboola Query Service from the running container; in local dev it reads from `.env.local`. Server-only `KBC_TOKEN` — never exposed to the client bundle.

## Quality-bar verification (Phase 3 polish, deployed)

Run on `https://meridian-2026-74011946.hub.europe-west3.gcp.keboola.com/`
with Lighthouse 13 / headless Chrome.

**Why SEO is 63 and not 95:** the Keboola hub serves `Disallow: /` at `/robots.txt`
from its outer proxy before our Next.js app ever sees the request. Shipping
`app/robots.ts` and `app/sitemap.ts` doesn't help — the proxy intercepts. The
hub URL was never meant to be the canonical SEO target. A real production deploy
would CNAME a real domain (e.g. `meridian.com`) at the data app and `robots.txt`
would be served from a CDN above the proxy. Documented and accepted.

**Why mobile perf is 80 and not 92:** the R3F + three.js + motion stack ships
~170kB of JS on the landing route. Under Lighthouse mobile (slow 4G + 4x CPU
slowdown) that costs ~3.3s LCP and ~500ms TBT. Hitting ≥ 92 would require
removing R3F from the landing — which would also remove the hero shader, which
is half the reason the page exists. The desktop perf score is 100, which is the
profile real users on the target audience hardware will see.

## Decisions explicitly punted

- Whether the dark/light toggle is exposed in the header chrome or only via system preference — defer until the page composition phase tells us whether the toggle needs to be a brand moment.
- Whether the command palette ships in v1 — `cmdk` is in deps but no UI commits to it yet.
- Page transition specifics (shared element morphs) — wired generically via View Transitions API in `globals.css`; per-route choreography added in Phase 2.
